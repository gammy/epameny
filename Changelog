1.0.1:
    - Combine the four beg/end variables into two; see MIGRATING for details.
    - Change the default trim marker column from 40% of the terminal width to
      100%, i.e the right edge.
    - A new configuration variable, `meny_reset`, has been added. It contains
      the ANSI escape sequence printed on epameny start and after each label
      has been printed. The default is "0m" (SGR), which is the same as before.
    - Epameny now explicitly checks that Bash is newer than or equal to 4.3,
      as that's the minimum version required. Some systems (notably MacOS)
      (at the time of writing) ships with Bash 3.2 from 2006. The reason for
      this is probably because that's when Bash changed its license from GPL2
      to GPL3. Epameny makes use of variable references (`local -n`) and other
      features which are not available in these versions.
    - Miscellaneous minor changes
